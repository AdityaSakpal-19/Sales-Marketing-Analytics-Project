### Analytical Approach

- Evaluated regional sales distribution to assess concentration risk and growth balance.
- Analyzed acquisition channels to compare revenue contribution and efficiency across Partner, Organic, Referral, and Paid Ads.
- Assessed discount impact to identify categories with higher promotional dependency.

### Key Insights

- Review discount strategies for underperforming categories to reduce margin leakage.
- Reallocate marketing spend toward Partner and Organic channels.
